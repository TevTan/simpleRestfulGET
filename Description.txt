This project allow me to understand more about RESTful web service. 
Even though the current method is GET, it still give me some clues on 
how it will be like using POST method. GET method is use to retrieve the data 
from server. No changes to server or resource. Where POST method perform changes
to server which is create resources in server. POST is not idempotent. 
So, if you retry the request for N times, you will end up having N resources
with N different URLs created on server. In according, to what I have found,
those who use web service with POST method also use database. 
So, I think that I may need one as well.

As for JSON format, I can use header as JSON as well as json_encode and
json_decode functions in php for input and output.
